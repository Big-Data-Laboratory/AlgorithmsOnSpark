# Distributed Algorithm On Spark

This project implement some popular algorithms on spark.You can read the papers of them to see their details.

Currently it support the flowing algorithms and I will add some other algorithms in the future.

- Distributed KNN
- Distributed DBSCAN
- Down Sampling
- Over Samping


This project support spark 2.x
